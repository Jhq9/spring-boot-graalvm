An example REST based Spring Boot application, that runs with GraalVM

> This project here shows a technical demo of what's possible right now - stable GraalVM Native Image support for Spring Boot could be expected with [Spring Frameworks 5.3 release planned in October 2020](https://spring.io/blog/2019/12/03/spring-framework-maintenance-roadmap-in-2020-including-4-3-eol), on which Spring Boot 2.4 will be based.

# New to GraalVM with Spring Boot?

Current status of Spring's Graal support: 

* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/GraalVM-native-image-support
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/22968

> Note: [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is an umbrella for many projects - if we want to fasten the startup and reduce the footprint of our Spring Boot projects, we need to focus on [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/).  

### Graal Native Image & SpringBoot

There are some good intro resources - like the [Running Spring Boot Applications as GraalVM Native Images talk @ Spring One Platform 2019](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/spring-boot-graalvm/) by [Andy Clement](https://twitter.com/andy_clement).

One could tell Native Image to initialize Java classes 

```
# at build time:
native image --initialize-at-build-time=your.package.YourClass
 
# or at runtime
native image --initialize-at-run-time=your.package.YourClass
``` 

GraalVM Native Image supports:
 
* __static configuration:__ via JSON files
  * either hand-crafted or 
  * [generated by Graal Native Image agent](https://medium.com/graalvm/introducing-the-tracing-agent-simplifying-graalvm-native-image-configuration-c3b56c486271))
* __dynamic configuration:__ with the help of a [Graal Feature interface](https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/index.html?org/graalvm/nativeimage/hosted/Feature.html)
  * implementing classes are called back throughout the image build process (see https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/REFLECTION.md#manual-configuration)

### Dynamic Graal Native Image configuration with @AutomaticFeature

[Andy Clement](https://twitter.com/andy_clement) also seems to lead a Spring experimental project, that provides a Graal @AutomaticFeature for typical Spring application: https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native

There are also already some example projects available: https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native/tree/master/spring-graal-native-samples 


# Install GraalVM with SDKMAN

Let's install GraalVM with the help of SDKMAN. Therefore you need to [have SDKMAN itself installed](https://sdkman.io/install):

```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

If SDKMAN has been installed successfully, the following command should work:

```
$ sdk list java

================================================================================
Available Java Versions
================================================================================
 Vendor        | Use | Version      | Dist    | Status     | Identifier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 AdoptOpenJDK  |     | 14.0.0.j9    | adpt    |            | 14.0.0.j9-adpt
               |     | 14.0.0.hs    | adpt    |            | 14.0.0.hs-adpt
               |     | 13.0.2.j9    | adpt    |            | 13.0.2.j9-adpt
... 
 GraalVM       |     | 20.0.0.r11   | grl     |            | 20.0.0.r11-grl
               |     | 20.0.0.r8    | grl     |            | 20.0.0.r8-grl
               |     | 19.3.1.r11   | grl     |            | 19.3.1.r11-grl
...
```

The list itself is much longer and you could see the wonderful simplicity of this approach: Don't ever mess again with JDK installations!

Now to install GraalVM based on JDK11, simply run:

```
sdk install java 20.0.0.r11-grl
``` 

SDKMAN now installs GraalVM for us. To have the correct `PATH` configuration in place, you may need to restart your console. If everything went fine, you should see `java -version` react like this:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.6" 2020-01-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 20.0.0 (build 11.0.6+9-jvmci-20.0-b02)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 20.0.0 (build 11.0.6+9-jvmci-20.0-b02, mixed mode, sharing)
```



### Install GraalVM Native Image

GraalVM brings a special tool `gu` - the GraalVM updater. To list everything thats currently installed, run

```
$ gu list
ComponentId              Version             Component name      Origin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
graalvm                  20.0.0              GraalVM Core
```

Now to install GraalVM Native image, simply run:

```
gu install native-image
```

After that, the `native-image` command should work for you:

```
$ native-image --version
GraalVM Version 20.0.0 CE
```


# Create a simple WebFlux Reactive REST Spring Boot app

As famous [starbuxman](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) suggests, we start at: https://start.spring.io/!

As https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/GraalVM-native-image-support suggests, the GraalVM Native Image support becomes better every day - so [we should choose the newest Spring Boot `2.3` Milestone release](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native) available:

> Spring Boot 2.3.0.M1 (you may be able to get some things working with Boot 2.2.X but not 2.1 or earlier)

![spring.start.io](screenshots/spring.start.io.png)      

Stable Native Image support for Spring Boot could be expected with [Spring Frameworks 5.3 release planned in October 2020](https://spring.io/blog/2019/12/03/spring-framework-maintenance-roadmap-in-2020-including-4-3-eol), on which Spring Boot 2.4 will be based.

Let's create a simple Spring Boot Reactive REST service. First we need a Handler like [HelloHandler](src/main/java/io/jonashackt/springbootgraal/HelloHandler.java):

```java
package io.jonashackt.springbootgraal;

import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.BodyInserters;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.ServerRequest;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.ServerResponse;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Component
public class HelloHandler {

    protected static String RESPONSE_TEXT= "Hello Reactive People!";

    public Mono<ServerResponse> hello(ServerRequest serverRequest) {
        return ServerResponse
                        .ok()
                        .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
                        .body(BodyInserters.fromValue(RESPONSE_TEXT));
    }
}
```

In the Reactive Spring approach we also need a Router - let's create [HelloRouter](src/main/java/io/jonashackt/springbootgraal/HelloRouter.java):

```java
package io.jonashackt.springbootgraal;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.*;

@Component
public class HelloRouter {

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route(HelloHandler helloHandler) {
        return RouterFunctions.route(
                RequestPredicates.GET("/hello").and(RequestPredicates.accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)),
                serverRequest -> helloHandler.hello(serverRequest)
        );
    }
}
```

Now we have everything in place to create a Testcase [HelloRouterTest](src/test/java/io/jonashackt/springbootgraal/HelloRouterTest.java) using the non-blocking [WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html):

```java
package io.jonashackt.springbootgraal;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.web.server.LocalServerPort;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringExtension;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.ClientResponse;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest(
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT
)
class HelloRouterTest {

	@LocalServerPort
	private int port;

	private WebClient webClient;

	@BeforeEach
	public void init() {
		webClient = WebClient.create("http://localhost:" + port);
	}

	@Test void
	should_call_reactive_rest_resource() {
		Mono<ClientResponse> result = webClient
				.get()
				.uri("/hello")
				.accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
				.exchange();

		assertEquals(HelloHandler.RESPONSE_TEXT, result.flatMap(response -> response.bodyToMono(String.class)).block());
	}
}
``` 

If you want to create another Spring Boot app I can recomment the great [Getting Started Guides](https://spring.io/guides)!



# Make Spring Boot app Graal Native Image friendly

From https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/GraalVM-native-image-support#experimental-support:

> "The spring-graal-native experimental project, created by Andy Clement, shows how it is possible to run a Spring Boot application out of the box as a GraalVM native image. It could be used as a basis for a potential upcoming official support."

So let's try this currently available implementation!


### Relocate Annotation classpath scanning from runtime to build time

The `spring-context-indexer` is an Annotation processor, which pushes the scan for Annotations from runtime to build time - see the docs: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-scanning-index:

> While classpath scanning is very fast, it is possible to improve the startup performance of large applications by creating a static list of candidates at compilation time. In this mode, all modules that are target of component scan must use this mechanism.

We could use the spring-context-indexer via importing it with Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-context-indexer</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

This would produce a `META-INF/spring.components` file containing a list of all Spring Compontens, Entities and so on.

__But we don't have to do this manually__, since the [Spring Graal @AutomaticFeature](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native) (again, this is in experimental stage right now) does this automatically for us.

The `@AutomaticFeature` will additionally chase down imported annotated classes like `@Import` - it knows, which kinds of annotations lead to reflection needs at runtime, which with GraalVM need to be registered at build time.

And as resource files like `application.properties` also need to be registered at build time, the Feature covers those too. 


### Disable usage of GCLIB proxies

With Spring Boot 2.2 GCLIB proxies are no longer necessary - it introduces the new `proxyBeanMethods` option to avoid GCLIB processing. Let's have a look at our [SpringBootHelloApplication.java](src/main/java/io/jonashackt/springbootgraal/SpringBootHelloApplication.java):

```java
@SpringBootApplication(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class SpringBootHelloApplication {
    ...
}
```

The usage of [JDK Proxies is supported by GraalVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/DYNAMIC_PROXY.md), they just need to be registered at build time. This is also taken care of by the [Spring Graal @AutomaticFeature](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native).


### Detect Autoconfiguration

Spring Boot ships with lot's of autoconfiguration projects, which only kick in, when there are specific classes found on the class path. Since this is done at runtime, it wouldn't work with GraalVM.

But the [SpringBootHelloApplication.java](src/main/java/io/jonashackt/springbootgraal/SpringBootHelloApplication.java) also takes care of this. It simply analyses the `META-INF/spring.factories` file, where the autoconfiguration classes are listed. An [example of such a file](https://github.com/codecentric/cxf-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/cxf-spring-boot-starter/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories) could be found in the community-driven Spring Boot Starter [cxf-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/codecentric/cxf-spring-boot-starter).

The `@AutomaticFeature` again pulls the work from runtime to build time - and eliminates the need for runtime autoconfiguration.


### Get Spring Graal @AutomaticFeature

In order to compile our Spring Boot App as a Native Image, we need to have the latest [Spring Graal @AutomaticFeature](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native) in place. As until March 2020 there was no Maven Dependency available, since this project is in a very early stage of development I guess. So I initially crafted a script `get-spring-feature.sh` that cloned and build the project for local usage.

But the Spring guys are moving fast! As there was also [a spring.io post released by starbuxman](https://spring.io/blog/2020/04/16/spring-tips-the-graalvm-native-image-builder-feature) at 16th of April, I think he got [Andy Clement](https://twitter.com/andy_clement) and [Sébastien Deleuze](https://twitter.com/sdeleuze) to get him a Maven dependecy available on https://repo.spring.io/milestone :)

So there we go! Now we don't need to manually download and compile the @AutomaticFeature, we simply add a dependency to our [pom.xml](pom.xml):

```
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.experimental</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-graal-native</artifactId>
			<version>0.6.1.RELEASE</version>
		</dependency>
    ...

	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>spring-milestones</id>
			<name>Spring Milestones</name>
			<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
	<pluginRepositories>
		<pluginRepository>
			<id>spring-milestones</id>
			<name>Spring Milestones</name>
			<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
		</pluginRepository>
	</pluginRepositories>

```

Be sure to also have the separate `Spring Milestones` repository definition in place, since the library isn't available on Maven Central right now!

### Craft a compile.sh script

I'am pretty sure, that this step described here will not be necessary when Spring will officially release the Graal full support. But right now, we do need to do a little grunt work here.

There are great examples of working compile scripts inside the [spring-graal-native-samples](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-graal-native/tree/master/spring-graal-native-samples) project. So let's try to derive our own from that - just have a look into this project's [compile.sh](compile.sh):

```shell script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "$1" ];
  then
    echo "[--> ERROR] Please provide your Spring Boot Main class as script parameter like this: ./compile.sh your.package.YourSpringBootApplicationClass"
    exit
fi
echo "[-->] Using Mainclass '$1' provided as parameter"
MAINCLASS=$1

echo "[-->] Detect artifactId from pom.xml"
ARTIFACT=$(mvn -q \
-Dexec.executable=echo \
-Dexec.args='${project.artifactId}' \
--non-recursive \
exec:exec);
echo "artifactId is '$ARTIFACT'"

echo "[-->] Detect artifact version from pom.xml"
VERSION=$(mvn -q \
  -Dexec.executable=echo \
  -Dexec.args='${project.version}' \
  --non-recursive \
  exec:exec);
echo "artifact version is $VERSION"
```

The first part of the script is dedicated to define needed variables for later GraalVM Native Image compilation. The variables `ARTIFACT` and `VERSION` could be simply derived from our [pom.xml](pom.xml) with [the help of the Maven exec plugin](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26514030/4964553).

It would be also cool, if we were able to retrieve the needed Spring Boot Main class name automatically, but I sadly didn't find a way. Therefore, I defined a parameter to run this [compile.sh](compile.sh) script properly - simply insert your Spring Boot Main class `./compile.sh io.jonashackt.springbootgraal.SpringBootHelloApplication`

In the next section of the [compile.sh](compile.sh) script, we clean (aka remove) the `target` directory and build our Spring Boot App via a well known `mvn package`:

```shell script
echo "[-->] Cleaning target directory & creating new one"
rm -rf target
mkdir -p target/native-image

echo "[-->] Build Spring Boot App with mvn package"
mvn -DskipTests package
```


After the build, the Spring Boot fat jar needs to be expanded and the classpath needs to be set to the content of the results.

Also the Spring Graal AutomaticFeature needs to be available on the classpath. Therefore we need the correct path to the `spring-graal-native-0.6.1.RELEASE.jar` file inside our `compile.sh` script:

```shell script
echo "[-->] Expanding the Spring Boot fat jar"
JAR="$ARTIFACT-$VERSION.jar"
cd target/native-image
jar -xvf ../$JAR >/dev/null 2>&1
cp -R META-INF BOOT-INF/classes

echo "[-->] Set the classpath to the contents of the fat jar & add the Spring Graal AutomaticFeature to the classpath"
LIBPATH=`find BOOT-INF/lib | tr '\n' ':'`
MAVEN_REPO_HOME=~/.m2/repository
FEATURE=$MAVEN_REPO_HOME/org/springframework/experimental/spring-graal-native/0.6.1.RELEASE/spring-graal-native-0.6.1.RELEASE.jar
CP=BOOT-INF/classes:$LIBPATH:$FEATURE
```

The script assumes, that your Maven repository resides in your user home under `~/.m2/repository` - change that the variable `MAVEN_REPO_HOME` inside the [compile.sh](compile.sh), if that isn't the case! 

Now finally the GraalVM Native Image compilation is triggered with lot's of appropriate configuration options:

```shell script
GRAALVM_VERSION=`native-image --version`
echo "[-->] Compiling Spring Boot App '$ARTIFACT' with $GRAALVM_VERSION"
time native-image \
  --no-server \
  --no-fallback \
  --initialize-at-build-time \
  -H:+TraceClassInitialization \
  -H:Name=$ARTIFACT \
  -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \
  -DremoveUnusedAutoconfig=true \
  -DremoveYamlSupport=true \
  -cp $CP $MAINCLASS;
```

I altered this section compared to the example scripts also, since I wanted to see the compilation process in my console.


### Run the compile.sh script & start your native Spring Boot App

We can now run the compile script with: 

```shell script
./compile.sh io.jonashackt.springbootgraal.SpringBootHelloApplication
```

The compile step does take it's time (depending on your hardware!). On my MacBook Pro 2017 this takes around 3 to 4 minutes. I prepared a small asciinema record so that you can have a look at how the compilation process works:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/320745.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/320745)


If your console shows something like the following:

```shell script

real	3m54.635s

sys	1m55.756s
```
 
you're now be able to __fire up your first GraalVM Native App!__. How cool is that?!! All you have to do is to run the generated executable `/target/native-image/spring-graal-vm`:

```shell script
$ ./target/native-image/spring-graal-vm

# Build and Run your Native Image compilation on a Cloud-CI provider like TravisCI

As we are used to test-driven development and we rely on very new code, which is for sure subject to change in the near future, we should be also able to automatically run our GraalVM Native image complilation on a Cloud CI provider like 

In order to run the compilation process, we need to [install GraalVM and GraalVM Native Image first on TravisCI](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61254927/4964553). Therefore let's have a look into our [.travis.yml](.travis.yml):

```yaml
distro: bionic
language: minimal

install:
  # Install GraalVM with SDKMAN
  - curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
  - source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
  - sdk install java 20.0.0.r11-grl

  # Check if GraalVM was installed successfully
  - java -version

  # Install Maven, that uses GraalVM for later builds
  - sdk install maven

  # Show Maven using GraalVM JDK
  - mvn --version

  # Install GraalVM Native Image
  - gu install native-image

  # Check if Native Image was installed properly
  - native-image --version

script:
  # Run GraalVM Native Image compilation of Spring Boot App

```

There are two main things to notice here: First we simply leverage the power of SDKMAN again to install GraalVM, as we already did on our local machines.

Second: __Don't use a `language: java` or the default linux distros like `distro: bionic`!__, because they ship with pre-installed Maven versions, which is configured to use the pre-installed OpenJDK - and __NOT our GraalVM installation__.

Therefore we simply use the `language: minimal`, which is [a simple way of getting our Travis builds based on a basic Travis build environment without pre-installed JDKs or Maven](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44738181/4964553) together with `distro: bionic` which will tell Travis to use the latest available `minimal` build image (see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/minimal-and-generic/).


# Use Docker to compile a Spring Boot App with GraalVM

There's an [official Docker image from Oracle](https://hub.docker.com/r/oracle/graalvm-ce/tags), but this one sadyl lacks both Maven with it's `mvn` command and the `native-image` plugin also not installed.

But again our Spring guys have something for us: There's a derived Docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/springci/graalvm-ce-java8 we can simply use - it adds Maven and Native-Image so we can just use it.

When I first thought about a Docker usage, I started to craft a `Dockerfile` - but then I realized, that there's [no easy way of using Docker volumes at Docker build time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51086724/docker-build-using-volumes-at-build-time). But I really wanted to mount a Docker volume to my local Maven repository like `--volume "$HOME"/.m2:/root/.m2` to prevent the download of all the Spring Maven dependencies over and over again every time we start our Docker container.

So I went with another way: We simply use a `docker run` command, that will compile our native Spring Boot app into our project's working directory (with `--volume $(pwd):/build`):

```
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume $(pwd):/build \
    --workdir /build \
    --volume "$HOME"/.m2:/root/.m2 \
    springci/graalvm-ce-java8:20.1.0-dev_20200125-1203 ./compile.sh io.jonashackt.springbootgraal.SpringBootHelloApplication
```

> There's no `latest` image of `springci/graalvm-ce-java8` - so we need to explicitely use a tag like `springci/graalvm-ce-java8:20.1.0-dev_20200125-1203`
